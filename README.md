## DESCRIPTION:

The pokemons (the fruits) are divided randomly on a directed and weighted graph, while the Team Rocket (the agents) try to catch as much pokemos as they can, until the game ends.
There are 23 different arenas that the game can be played in.
The objective, of course, is to get the best score in the time left until the end of the game - with the smallest number of "moves" (calls to the server).


## RUNNING THE GAME:

1. Clone the project.
2. go to: `OOP-POKEMON\out\artifacts\OOP_POKEMON_jar\OOP_POKEMON.jar`.
3. a window should come up. unter your ID (if you would like) and the desired level (0-23).

4. a different window of the game should come up. the agents will start collecting the fruits (pokemons) autonomously, by our planning algorithms (shown in wiki). you can see the time left until the end of the game, the current score of the agents and the number of moves that as been made from the beginning.
